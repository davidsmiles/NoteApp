# NoteApp

This Note App comes with it features of using Speech as input to save your notes in it or traditionally type your message.
It solely depends on the User's preferred mode of Input.

Also, Users can choose to have their App read the note they've saved to your their hearing if they don'f feel like focusing to read the note.
This has been done by carefully implementing the Google Text-To-Speech API.

Thank you.
